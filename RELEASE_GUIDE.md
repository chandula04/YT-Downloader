## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- ✅ Python 3.13+ installed
- ✅ Git installed and configured
- ✅ GitHub account with YT-Downloader repository
- ✅ All dependencies installed:
  ```cmd
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Optional
- Inno Setup (for creating installer) - [Download here](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)

## 🏗️ Building the Application

### Step 1: Update Version Number

**IMPORTANT**: Always increment version before building!

Edit `config/settings.py`:
```python
APP_VERSION = "2.0.0"  # Change this to your new version
```

### Step 2: Run Build Script

Open Command Prompt in project folder and run:
```cmd
build_installer.bat
```

**What it does:**
1. Upgrades PyInstaller
2. Builds standalone `.exe` file
3. Packages all assets (ffmpeg, config, etc.)
4. Creates installer (if Inno Setup installed)

**Build Output:**
- `dist\YouTube Downloader.exe` - **Use this for releases!** (25-35 MB)
- `installer\Output\YouTubeDownloaderSetup.exe` - Optional installer

**Build Time**: ~2-5 minutes depending on your PC

## 🛠️ Fixing "Can't Run on Your PC" Error

### What Does This Error Mean?

When your friend sees **"This app can't run on your PC"**, it means:
- ❌ Architecture mismatch (32-bit vs 64-bit)
- ❌ Missing dependencies (rare with PyInstaller)
- ❌ Corrupted download

### Check Windows Architecture

**Your Friend Should Check Their Windows Type:**

1. Right-click **"This PC"** on desktop
2. Click **"Properties"**
3. Look at **"System type"**:
   - **"64-bit operating system"** = Needs 64-bit exe ✅ (99% of users)
   - **"32-bit operating system"** = Needs 32-bit exe ⚠️ (rare)

### Solution 1: Build for Correct Architecture

**PyInstaller builds for YOUR system:**
- If you have 64-bit Windows → creates 64-bit exe
- If you have 32-bit Windows → creates 32-bit exe

**Most Common Setup:**
- You build on 64-bit Windows
- Most users have 64-bit Windows  
- Everyone is happy! ✅

**Problem:**
- You build on 64-bit Windows
- Friend has old 32-bit Windows
- Error appears ❌

### Solution 2: Create Both Versions (Advanced)

**For Maximum Compatibility:**

1. **Build 64-bit Version** (on 64-bit Windows):
   ```cmd
   build_installer.bat
   move "dist\YouTube Downloader.exe" "dist\YouTube Downloader_x64.exe"
   ```

2. **Build 32-bit Version** (on 32-bit Windows OR use 32-bit Python):
   ```cmd
   build_installer.bat
   move "dist\YouTube Downloader.exe" "dist\YouTube Downloader_x86.exe"
   ```

3. **Upload BOTH to GitHub Release**

4. **Update Release Description:**
   ```markdown
   ## 📥 Downloads
   
   Choose the right version for your Windows:
   
   - 🔷 **YouTube Downloader_x64.exe** - For Windows 10/11 (64-bit) ⬇️ **[RECOMMENDED - 99% of users]**
   - 🔶 **YouTube Downloader_x86.exe** - For older Windows (32-bit) ⬇️ [Rare]
   
   **Not sure which one?** Download x64 version - it works for almost everyone!
   
   **How to check:** Right-click "This PC" → Properties → See "System type"
   ```

### Solution 3: Quick Fixes

**If rebuilding isn't an option:**

1. **Install Visual C++ Redistributable:**
   - Download: [VC++ 2015-2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
   - Install it
   - Try running exe again

2. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click exe
   - "Run as administrator"

3. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily:**
   - Some antivirus blocks new executables
   - Whitelist your app

4. **Re-download:**
   - File might be corrupted
   - Download fresh copy from GitHub

### How to Know Which Version You Built

**Check YOUR Windows:**
```cmd
systeminfo | findstr /C:"System Type"
```

**Output:**
- `x64-based PC` = You built 64-bit exe
- `x86-based PC` = You built 32-bit exe

## 🔄 How Auto-Update Works

### User Experience

1. **User opens app**
2. **App checks GitHub** (in background, on startup)
3. **New version found**:
   - Notification bell shows badge: 🔔 1
   - Click bell to see update details
4. **User clicks "Update Now"**:
   - App downloads new exe
   - Shows progress bar
   - Installs automatically
5. **App restarts** with new version! ✨

### Technical Details

**Version Check:**
- Compares `APP_VERSION` with GitHub release tag
- Uses GitHub API: `/repos/chandula04/YT-Downloader/releases/latest`

**Download Process:**
- Downloads from release assets
- Shows real-time progress
- Saves to temp folder

**Installation:**
- Creates batch script
- Closes current app
- Replaces old exe with new one
- Launches new version
- Deletes batch script

### Requirements for Auto-Update to Work

- ✅ GitHub release is published (not draft)
- ✅ Tag matches version format (`v2.0.0`)
- ✅ .exe file is attached to release
- ✅ User has internet connection
- ✅ No antivirus blocking download

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**❌ PyInstaller not found**
```cmd
pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
```

**❌ Build fails with errors**
```cmd
# Clean previous builds
rmdir /s /q build dist
del *.spec

# Try again
build_installer.bat
```

**❌ "Module not found" errors**
```cmd
# Reinstall all dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Release Issues

**❌ Auto-update not detecting new version**

Check:
1. Tag format: Must be `v2.0.0` (with 'v')
2. Release is published (not draft)
3. Tag matches `APP_VERSION`
4. Release is marked as "latest"

**❌ Download link broken**

- Ensure .exe is uploaded to release assets
- Check file uploaded completely (full size)
- Verify public repository access

**❌ Update downloads but won't install**

- User might need admin rights
- Antivirus might be blocking
- Try disabling Windows Defender temporarily

### Runtime Issues

**❌ App crashes on startup**
```cmd
# Run from terminal to see errors
cd dist
"YouTube Downloader.exe"
```

**❌ Missing FFmpeg**
- Ensure `--add-data "ffmpeg;ffmpeg"` in build command
- Check ffmpeg folder exists in dist

**❌ "No module named 'config'"**
- Ensure `--add-data "config;config"` in build command
- Check config folder exists in dist

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always test before releasing** - Save yourself embarrassment!

2. **Keep old versions** - In case you need to rollback

3. **Version incrementally** - Don't jump from 1.0.0 to 5.0.0

4. **Write good release notes** - Users appreciate knowing what changed

5. **Backup before building** - In case something goes wrong

6. **Test on multiple PCs** - Catch compatibility issues early

7. **Monitor user feedback** - Fix issues in next release

8. **Don't release on Friday** - No one to fix issues over weekend!
