# Dynamic Quality Filtering Fix

## Problem Fixed
The quality selector menu was showing all possible video qualities (including 8K, 4K, 2K) even when those qualities weren't available for the specific YouTube video being loaded.

## Root Cause
In `core/youtube_handler.py`, the `get_quality_options()` method had forced addition of high-end qualities:

```python
# ALWAYS ensure 8K option is present (even if not actually available)
# ALWAYS ensure 4K option is present  
# ALWAYS ensure 2K option is present
```

This meant that even if a video only supported up to 720p, the menu would still show 8K, 4K, and 2K options.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Forced Quality Addition
- **Before**: Always added 8K (4320p), 4K (2160p), and 2K (1440p) options regardless of availability
- **After**: Only shows qualities that are actually available in the video streams

### 2. Conservative Fallback Options
- **Before**: When no streams detected, provided comprehensive list including 8K, 4K, 2K
- **After**: When no streams detected, provides basic common qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)

### 3. Improved Throttling Fallback
- **Before**: Throttling error returned all possible qualities including 8K, 4K, 2K
- **After**: Throttling error returns basic common qualities that most videos support

## Code Changes

### File: `core/youtube_handler.py`

#### Change 1: Removed forced quality addition (lines ~457-489)
```python
# OLD CODE (REMOVED):
# ALWAYS ensure 8K option is present (even if not actually available)
# ALWAYS ensure 4K option is present
# ALWAYS ensure 2K option is present

# NEW CODE:
# Only show qualities that are actually available in the video streams
# (Remove the forced addition of 8K, 4K, 2K options that may not exist)
```

#### Change 2: Conservative basic fallbacks (lines ~400-450)
```python
# OLD: Comprehensive list with 8K, 4K, 2K fallbacks
fallback_options = [
    ("4320p", "8K", 50000000),   # 8K Ultra HD
    ("2160p", "4K", 25000000),   # 4K Ultra HD
    ("1440p", "2K", 10000000),   # 2K Quad HD
    ...
]

# NEW: Basic common quality fallbacks
fallback_options = [
    ("1080p", "Full HD", 5000000), # Full HD - most common
    ("720p", "HD", 2500000),       # HD Ready - very common  
    ("480p", "SD", 800000),        # Standard Definition - common
    ("360p", "", 300000),          # Low Quality - universal
    ("240p", "", 150000),          # Very Low Quality - universal
]
```

#### Change 3: Basic throttling fallback (lines ~520-530)
```python
# OLD: All qualities including 8K, 4K, 2K
return [
    "4320p - Adaptive (~15 GB) (8K)",
    "2160p - Adaptive (~7.5 GB) (4K)",
    "1440p - Adaptive (~3 GB) (2K)",
    ...
]

# NEW: Basic common qualities only
return [
    "1080p - Adaptive (~1.5 GB) (Full HD)",
    "720p - Adaptive (~700 MB) (HD)",
    "480p - Adaptive (~300 MB) (SD)",
    "360p - Adaptive (~150 MB)",
    "240p - Adaptive (~75 MB)"
]
```

## Result
- ✅ Quality menu now shows only available video qualities
- ✅ No more misleading 8K/4K/2K options for videos that don't support them  
- ✅ Cleaner, more accurate user experience
- ✅ Fallback options are more realistic and commonly supported

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run `run_new.bat` to start the YouTube Downloader
2. Load different types of videos (older videos, music videos, etc.)
3. Check that quality menu only shows actually available options
4. Verify that high-quality videos still show their full quality range

The quality selector will now dynamically populate based on what YouTube actually provides for each specific video.
